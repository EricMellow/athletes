WELCOME
=======

We want you to build a small application with two screens (see design-assets folder):
1. Home - Displays athletes with links to each athlete's profile
2. Athlete Profile - Displays training data for a single athlete


DESIGN
======
Designs sometimes arrive in the form of wireframe sketches.
We want you to use your best judgement for interpreting these designs and applying them within code.


EXISTING CODE
=============
To help you get started, we've included some code and infrastructure:
* React using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
* TypeScript declarations
* Base style files
* Useful API methods for fetching data - these just access local JSON files

You are free to use these helpers or not.
For instance, you may choose to use JavaScript over TypeScript.

Please do not feel bound by any coding conventions you see here.
Use your own best judgement for the structure of directories, files, and code.

GRAPHING
========
The Athlete Profile design contains placeholders for two vertical bar graphs.
You are free to choose any graphing library or roll your own.
If you're unsure where to start, we recommend trying [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).


GETTING STARTED
===============
Start by installing the npm dependencies:
### `npm install`

Then launch the project by running:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.


TESTING
=======
This project uses Jest for automated testing.
### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


STANDARDS FOR QUALITY
=====================
Your code test submission will be reviewed by our entire engineering team
and we thrive on quality. At a minimum, we expect your submission to include:
* High readability
* Consistent formatting with a high level of attention to detail
* Well named variables, functions, classes, directories, and files
* Clean separation of concerns
* Automated testing
* Concern for reusability and deduplication

We will also review your submission for:
* Design and interaction quality
